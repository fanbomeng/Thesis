%% I need to describe muon ID in chaper 4.2 and Tau decay mode finding, tau MVA ID around 4.2 too 
\chapter{LFV event selection}
For both the 8TeV analysis $H\rightarrow e\tau_h$ channel and 13TeV analysis  $H\rightarrow\mu\tau_h$, events are selected in several steps. The loose(base) selection on the different IDs, energy, geometry parameters of the analysis related objects and so on are applied. For both  $H\rightarrow e\tau_h$ and $H\rightarrow\mu\tau_h$ analysis channel, a following cut-based analyses are applied. For $H\rightarrow\mu\tau_h$, a multivariate analysis with Boosted decision tree (BDT) is exploited to provide more sensitive results. 



\section{$H\rightarrow\mu\tau_h$}
\subsection{Loose selection}
In $H\rightarrow\mu\tau_h$ events, tau leptons from signal events decay hadronically and most of the time, $\mu$ candidates pass all the way to the muon detector. SM higgs is much heavier than the LFV decay products $\mu$ and $\tau$, so $\mu$ and $\tau$ are expected to have high $P_{T}$. Since the decay products are boosted, a cut on the $\Delta R>0.3$ is applied, in which $\Delta$R is defined as $\Delta R=\sqrt(\Delta phi^{2}+\Delta eta^{2})$. Higgs particle has no charge, so $\mu$ and $\tau$ candidates are required to have opposite charges. Further, the events with additional $\mu$ and $\tau$ that pass a loose selection, the events with jets that are identified by the combined secondary vertex(CSVv2) b-tagging algorithm \cite{btag_ago} as a b quark jets will be vetoed. The $\mu$ from signal events are boosted and isolated, as mentioned in previous chapter, the trigger HLT\_IsoMu24 or HLT\_IsoTkMu24 is used, the trigger select isolated $\mu$ that have energy higher than 24GeV. An further $P_{T}$ cut on reconstruct $\mu$,  $P_{T}>26$GeV and $|\eta|<2.4$ are applied. $\mu$ are required to pass the recommended Medium $\mu$ ID(chapter 4.2) from CMS collaboration. $\mu$ are required to pass muon ID. For the LHC data 2016, running period BCDEF, ICHEP medium muon ID is applied(table~\ref{tbl:ICHEPMedID}), for running period G and H, also the monte Carlo samples, standard medium muon ID(table~\ref{tbl:standardMedID})are applied to achieve the best performance for muon identification.

Hadronic taus are required to have $P_T>30$GeV,$|\eta|<2.3$, pass old tau decay mode finding(chapter 4.2) and an MVA based tight tau isolation ID(chapter 4.2) and tau discriminators against other objects. These discriminators are very loose MVA based rejection against electrons and the cut-based tight rejection against muons.

The events in the analysis are divided into four categories based on the number of jets in the events. In 2-jets categories, it is furthered divided into 2 categories,  2-jet gluon gluon fusion higgs production(ggH) category and 2-jet VBF category based on the value of 2 jets invariant mass($M_{jj}$) . In the 0-jet category, the signal mainly comes from ggH. In 1-jet category, the dominant signal production mode is also ggH, but with a boosted jet associated with the production, some of the VBF higgs signal also shows up in this category. In the 2-jet ggH category, signal evens mainly comes from ggH and in 2-jet VBF, VBF production dominants the production mode.  In the following is a more detailed listing of the selection condition in each categories.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[{\bf 0-jet:}] No events have jets pass the loose PF ID and  with jet $P_T>30$ GeV, $|\eta|<4.7$.
\item[{\bf 1-jet:}] The events with one jet passes losse PF ID and jet $P_T>30$ GeV, $|\eta|<4.7$.
\item [{\bf 2-jets GG:}] The events have two jets pass loose PF ID and with jet $P_T>30$ GeV and $|\eta|<4.7$, also require an invariant mass of the two jets, $\textrm{M}_{jj}<550$ \GeV. 
\item [{\bf 2 jets VBF:}] The events have two jets pass loose PF ID and with jet $P_T>30$ GeV and $|\eta|<4.7$, also require $\textrm{M}_{jj}>550$ \GeV. 
\end{enumerate} The threshold on $\textrm{M}_{jj}$ has been optimized to give the best expected limits.


\subsection{Cut-based analysis}
With the loose selection, including the categorization, a further cut-based selection strategy is applied. The selected variables that can help distinguish signal from background used in this analysis are the following ones: $P_{T}^{\mu}$, $P_{T}^{\tau}$, $M_{T}(\tau_{h})$. The lepton $P_{T}$ variables are very powerful background discriminant variables, but it will also cause the problem that signal picks under the background. Leptons from signal process  incline to have higher $P_{T}$ values, by cutting tighter on the lepton $P_{T}$, more background events can be removed. However this will also reshape some of the backgrounds, making them peak closer under signal so as making the signal discovery processes affected more by the background statistics fluctuation. In the $H\rightarrow e\tau_h$ analysis, the effect of cutting hard on lepton $P_{T}$ will be shown. So in $H\rightarrow\mu\tau_h$ search, lepton $P_{T}$ variables are kept at loose values and tune on other variables to achieve better signal significance. 

The tuning process is done only with Monte Carlo samples to not double use data. The final results are extract with data, so the double use of data may cause a bias on results. The fake background estimated with full data driven method, with be replaced with the semi data driven estimation in tuning.  
In $M_{T}(\tau_{h})$  channel,  the variables tuned are $\textrm{M}_{jj}$ and $M_{T}(\tau_{h})$.

The cut thresholds have been optimized to give the most stringent expected limits based on an Asimov dataset. Examples of limits obtained from different threshold are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:optMT} for the $M_T(\tau, MET)$ for the different categories. Fig.~\ref{fig:optVBFmass} shows the optimization for the di-jet invariant mass for the two 2-jet categories.
